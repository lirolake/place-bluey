### How to get your reddit_session cookie
**NOTE: People have reported that this is annoying to do on chrome because text gets unselected. Therefore, we recommend that you use Firefox.**
People have reported that you can find it in: Dev Tools -> Application -> Cookies -> reddit_session
You could also use a cookie editor extension such as [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm)

1. Go to [r/place](https://reddit.com/r/place) (make sure you are logged in on the account you want to get the cookie for)
2. Open dev tools (F12 on Chrome) and go to the network tab
3. Refresh the page
4. Scroll all the way up and click on the first request to reddit.com/r/place
